# iScuzyScriptRunner
This is a project that I have taken on for my IT Dept. to aid in the daily running of the same scripts in hopes that this makes things a bit easier for them. This project uses a GUI created with PowerShell script and is currently a work in progress. This is a highly commented program that will hopefully allow others to follow the code a bit easier.
SPECIAL NOTE: Some buttons have been disabled at the current moment as there isn't a _Click event created yet. Once the click events have been added and the script is a bit more verbose, I will update the master file and remove this comment.
